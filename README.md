# Python-Projects-Scientific-Computing
These are projects I personally developed to strengthen my Python skills in scientific computing. Each project is fully implemented and documented to demonstrate my hands-on programming ability, problem-solving skills, and understanding of Python fundamentals.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Arithmetic Formatter
- Formats simple arithmetic problems (addition and subtraction) vertically and side-by-side.
- Handles up to 5 problems at a time with input validation.
- Optionally displays the answers.
- Skills demonstrated: string formatting, input validation, conditional logic.

### 2. Time Calculator
- Performs calculations involving time, such as adding or subtracting hours and minutes.
- Handles edge cases and invalid input gracefully.
- Skills demonstrated: datetime operations, input handling, logical problem solving.

### 3. Polygon Area Calculator
- Calculates the area of various polygons given user input for dimensions.
- Supports multiple shapes (triangle, rectangle, etc.).
- Skills demonstrated: mathematical computations, functions, input validation.

### 4. Probability Calculator
- Computes probability based on user input for different events.
- Includes validation for correct probability ranges.
- Skills demonstrated: mathematical logic, Python functions, error handling.
